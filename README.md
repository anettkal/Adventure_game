# Adventure_game
A simple version of an old-fashioned text-based adventure game. The game gives players a description of what's happening, and then asks them to make a choice. Something different happens depending on the choice the player made. The game also includes some random factors, so that it's a little different each time. The game has conditions for winning and losing. When the game is over, it asks if the player wants to play again.
